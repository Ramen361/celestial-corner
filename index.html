        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Ramen (She/Her)</strong>, a 14-year-old freshman with a passion for digital creation, web development, design, and interactive media. I enjoy combining creativity and functionality to build projects that are visually appealing, interactive, and user-friendly. I thrive on learning new skills, exploring innovative ideas, and collaborating with others to bring concepts to life.</p>

        <p>Alongside my technical pursuits, I have a strong interest in psychology and mental health, which informs my personal growth and the empathetic perspective I bring to my work. I enjoy journaling, therapy, climbing, walking, running, biking, and reading, activities that help me stay balanced, inspired, and reflective. I am also known for being trustworthy and non-judgmental, and many people feel comfortable confiding in me and relying on my support, which I take seriously and value deeply.</p>

        <p>Music and media play a major role in my life. My tastes range from <em>Spinvis, ppcocaine, Rebzyyx, Eminem, The Weeknd, Radiohead, James Arthur, Shinedown, Ashnikko, D4vd, XXXTENTACION, Chase Atlantic, Black Atlass, Odetari, Mila</em>, reflecting both my emotional depth and appreciation for experimental sounds. I also enjoy films and shows such as the <em>Twilight series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Pitch Perfect (1–3), and Remember Me</em>, which influence my storytelling and creative vision.</p>

        <p>I value quiet moments, rain, nighttime, and solitude, finding inspiration in reflection and imagination. I enjoy coffee, tea, boba, Monster drinks (orange cream/dreamsicle), bees, fairycore and dark fairycore aesthetics, and jewelry or accessories that allow me to express individuality. At the same time, I avoid loud or disrespectful environments, insects, makeup, celery, and Sprite, as these disrupt focus or comfort.</p>

        <p>Overall, I aim to grow continuously, explore my interests fully, build trusting connections with others, and create work that is meaningful, inspiring, and reflective of my personal vision.</p>
